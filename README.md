#Welcome to PfSense_USA_IPS_WALL!

This firewall setup is designed to allow only USA IPs, with the option to create exceptions for top rules if desired.

By limiting your outside traffic to a specific range of IP addresses, you can significantly reduce needless traffic that eats up costly bandwidth and server resources. This setup is suitable for both personal and business use, as it prevents outside IP addresses from accessing your web server, cameras, and other public-facing devices.

To ensure maximum security, it is important to lock down your outside traffic first before allowing updates from outside the USA IP address range. This can easily be accomplished by setting a tight IP address range, rather than allowing entire countries access.

This firewall setup is free to use and highly recommended to prevent exposing your business to the potential corruption of the internet. While it is true that even USA IPs can be rogue, setting up stick tables will further help prevent denial-of-service (DOS) attacks.

Furthermore, this firewall setup provides real-time monitoring of your traffic, allowing you to quickly identify any attacks and determine which countries they are coming from.

By using PfSense_USA_IPS_WALL, you can ensure that your PfSense BOX is tightened up and protected from potential security threats.

Thank you for using PfSense_USA_IPS_WALL, and God bless everyone!
